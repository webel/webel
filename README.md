# README

Hey, I'm Evie, I love git. I git everything. Very little goes public, so Github is mostly my scratch pad for front-end work. I hang out a lot elsewhere for work and, at times, under other handles.

As a programmer, I'm more of a less-is-more chick. Like... I don't get bloating a new project with all the bells and whistles that'll need upkeep while trying to move forward fast. My priority is the most bang for the buck early in a project while adhering to clean and beautiful code. With that said, I *love* a good abstraction with an intuitive interface, but starting there instead of a necessary refactor... meh.

*The General Problem - XKCD*

**Currently doing my own thing**;

- Working on [Grihasti](https://grihasti.space) with my brilliant partner who does everything but tech. You can help us out by taking our [survey](https://grihasti.space/research). We're working on recommendation systems for style and an LLM for fostering conscious living in homes. It all sounds very fancy because it is.

- Circulive, hand-in-hand with Grihasti we're creating a way for second-hand furniture to find new homes by labelling their style and matching up with users.

- [ChatterPaws](https://chatterpaws.xyz) a tool I built over a weekend for tracking my dog's talking progress. Yes, it's a thing; AIC â€“ Augmented Interspecies Communication.

- Bitcoin lightning stuff and renting GPU's.

- I regularly write scripts for people doing one-time tasks, like; transcribing from x source, migrating whatever database, executing something on Ethereum when gas is below y, idk... all sorts in all sorts of constellations.

---

- [thesis](https://thesis.stenqvist.co) for my ML masters at KTH, subject to change as soon as I'm provided with a supervisor. Finally, I found my own, a crypto fiend, but I lost drive by that point. I'll get back to it.
    + Website wise I had a nice time working out a supercheap solution; Github Pages, Formspark (25$ for 50k submissions regardless of project or time horizon) and Integromat (lofty free tier) to get a POAP code on form submission from a google sheet. So - 25$ without any running costs.
    + I have an AWS Open Search instance running, and a lightweight EC2 instance with a python script that populates the Open Search with tweets regarding "DAO". Don't think this'll actually work out for anything, I just like hoarding data.

- I used to be the product owner of [School Health](https://www.admentum.se/elevhalsa/) used by many schools across Sweden. Admentum was acquired in-part due to School Health. 

- [Bitsk](https://bitsk.it) lending my crypto know-how to businesses in Sweden.

> I don't have proper stats for 2022 and 2023 because I changed for to nvim and the waka plugin hasn't run properly ðŸ™ƒ

## 2021 Waka Stats - Time in editor

*Other is slightly misrepresented - there was an additional **100h** in the waka dropdown distributed across 20 different languages/formats*.

All those of you constantly labelling me "frontend first" (what, because I'm a she?!) TAKE THAT.

## Collab

<!-- "So, you've been a programmer for 10 years?" â€“ for the longest time, I felt like a complete failure in the space. I did not have a fun time starting out at uni. I didn't realise that everyone was flailing. I didn't realise that my lightweight solutions were often as good as the over-engineered solutions I assumed were correct... I didn't understand that the biggest egos, the ones making me feel useless, were the ones who knew the absolute least. -->

I shy away from OS work, but I *want* to do more open-source and be less afraid of social interaction. I'm a clinical hermit - I dare say so because I believe that I, and others, can do brilliant work regardless of how we fit into others' arbitrary structures of being rockstars.

I planned on being an elusive shadow coder for the rest of my working days, but I realised that if I wanted to be a part of web3 I needed to interact. I've pre-doxxed myself.
